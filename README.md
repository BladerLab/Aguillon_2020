#Here you will find data (.csv) for the trajectories of pioneer neurons (EON) and skin (SKIN) in different genetic conditions. -controls (wt) -neurog1 mutant (ng) -cxcr4b mutant (od) -cxcl12a mutant (me) -cxcr4b overexpression (sur_EON_Dis) -cxcr4b rescue in the neurog1 mutant (res_EON_Dis) or in several genetic conditions (wtmengod_EONSkin)
# You will also find the scripts in R used to generate the track plots for the figures of the following preprint:
